  \begin{itemize}
  \item To prove $f^{-1}(W)$ is a closed submanifold of $M$, we can check it locally on $M$ by the fact that  $f^{-1}(W)$ is a closed in $M$.
  \item Here we choose $V$ to be an open neiborhood of $N$, with coordinate $x_i$, $i=\{1,2, \ldots ,dim(N)\}$, and $V \cap W=\{ w\in V|x_i(w)=0,1 \leq i \leq codim(W,N)$, and let $U=f^{-1}(V)$, we only need to prove $f^{-1}(V\cap W)$ is a close submanifold of $U$.
  \item We define map $\phi$ from $U$ to $R^{codim(W,N)}$ by functions $y_i$, for $1\leq i\leq codim(W,N)$ s.t $y_i=f\circ x_i$. Then $f^{-1}(W\cap V)=\phi^{-1}(0)$ and 0 is a regular value of $\phi$ by the assumtion. Hence $f^{-1}(W\cap V)$ is a closed submanifold of $U$.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $T_gA$ is a compact operator, since $A$ is compact. Hence $T_f$ is fredholm every where.
  \item For $y \in H$, since $g$ is bounded, $f^{-1}(y)$ is bounded.
  \item For a regular value $y$, if $f^{-1}(y)$ is not finite, find a sequence $x_i$ s.t $Ax_i \to z_0$. Then $x_i=y+g(Ax_i) \to y+g(z_0)$, hence $x=y+g(z_0)$ also belongs to $f^{-1}(y)$ since $f$ is a smooth map. Thus by submersion theorem, $f^{-1}(y)$ is a locally dimension 0 manifold and hence discrete, which contradicts to the fact $x_i \to x$.
